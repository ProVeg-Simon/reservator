Description
-----------
UbiKampus Reservator is an Android application for displaying and reserving meeting rooms developed by Futurice and University of Helsinki. UbiKampus Reservator is a fork of the original Futurice Reservator at https://github.com/futurice/meeting-room-tablet. New features include support for Office365 calendars and a new UI. 

This application is meant for tablets so there are a few layout problems when using it on mobile phones.
